    <p>1. b TAG  </p>
    <p> the b for cases like keywords in a summary, product names in a review, or other spans of text whose typical presentation would be boldfaced (but not including any special importance). </p>

    <H2> Do not confuse the <b> element with the <strong>, <em>, or <mark> elements. The <strong> element represents text of certain importance, <em> puts some emphasis on the text and the <mark> element represents text of certain relevance. The <b> element doesn't convey such special semantic information; use it only when no others fit</h2>

     2 . Small 
   The small HTML element represents side-comments and small print, like copyright and legal text, independent of its styled presentation

        <br>


        <p>There is <del>nothing</del> <ins>no code</ins> either good or bad, but <del>thinking</del> <ins>running it</ins> makes
